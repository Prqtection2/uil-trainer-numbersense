The Key Insight:
• 75 is equal to ¾ × 100
• This means we can break down multiplication by 75 into three easy steps

For Multiplication (× 75):
1. Divide the number by 4
2. Multiply the result by 3
3. Multiply by 100 (add two zeros)

Example:
48 × 75 =
1. 48 ÷ 4 = 12
2. 12 × 3 = 36
3. 36 × 100 = 3,600

For Division (÷ 75):
1. Multiply the number by 4
2. Divide by 3
3. Divide by 100 (move decimal point left 2 places)

Example:
3,600 ÷ 75 =
1. 3,600 × 4 = 14,400
2. 14,400 ÷ 3 = 4,800
3. 4,800 ÷ 100 = 48

Practice Tips:
• Start with numbers easily divisible by 4
• Work up to two-digit numbers
• Try decimal numbers for a challenge`,
    examples: [
      '48 × 75 = 3,600',
      '64 × 75 = 4,800',
      '28 × 75 = 2,100',
      '3,600 ÷ 75 = 48',
      '4,800 ÷ 75 = 64'
    ]

MULTIPLICATION:
• Remember: 75 = ¾ × 100
• To multiply by 75:
  1. Divide by 4
  2. Multiply by 3
  3. Add two zeros

DIVISION:
• For division, we do the opposite:
  1. Multiply by 4
  2. Divide by 3
  3. Move decimal point left two places
• Example: 6,000 ÷ 75
  1. 6,000 × 4 = 24,000
  2. 24,000 ÷ 3 = 8,000
  3. 8,000 ÷ 100 = 80

DECIMALS:
• Same trick works with 7.5!
• 7.5 is just 75 ÷ 10
• Example: 40 × 7.5 = 300`,
    examples: [
      '148 × 75 = 11,100',
      '6,000 ÷ 75 = 80',
      '40 × 7.5 = 300'

ADVANCED OPERATIONS:
• Fractions vs Decimals
  8/75 vs 0.75 - convert to decimals to compare
  7/75 = 0.093333...

• Combined Operations
  15 × 75 × 4
  1. First multiply by 75 (15 ÷ 4 × 3 × 100)
  2. Then multiply by 4
  = (15 × 3 × 100) = 4,500

• Decimal Operations
  2.6 × 7.5 = (26 × 75) ÷ 100
  1.1 ÷ 7.5 = (110 ÷ 75) ÷ 10

PATTERNS:
• Look for patterns in results
• Use the relationship between 75 and 100
• Break down complex problems into simpler steps
• Remember: 75% = ¾ = 0.75`,
    examples: [
      '2.6 × 7.5 = 19.5',
      '15 × 75 × 4 = 4,500',
